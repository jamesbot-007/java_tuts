what is the use of new keyword

The primary difference between String a = "java"; and String name = new String("java"); lies in how the string objects are created and managed in memory:

1. String a = "java";
String Pool: The string "java" is stored in the String Pool, a special area of memory in the Java runtime.
Reusability: If another variable is assigned the same literal (String b = "java";), it will reference the same object in the pool rather than creating a new object. This helps conserve memory.
Efficiency: This approach is more efficient because it avoids creating multiple objects for the same string content.
2. String name = new String("java");
Heap Memory: This explicitly creates a new object in the heap memory, even if "java" already exists in the String Pool.
No Reusability: It does not use the existing object from the String Pool but creates a separate object with the same value.
Unnecessary in Most Cases: This is usually not needed unless you explicitly require a new object for some reason.
Behavior Example
java
Copy code
String a = "java";
String b = "java";
String name = new String("java");

// Comparisons
System.out.println(a == b); // true (both reference the same object in the String Pool)
System.out.println(a == name); // false (different memory locations)
System.out.println(a.equals(name)); // true (content is the same)
== compares references (memory locations).
.equals() compares the actual content of the strings.
Use of new Keyword
The new keyword in Java is used to create a new object in the heap memory. For example:

When you use new, a new memory allocation happens, ensuring the object is unique, even if it has the same content as another object.
When to Use new String()
Rarely. It is generally unnecessary for strings unless you need a guaranteed unique object for some specific use case.
Best Practice
Use string literals (String a = "java";) whenever possible for efficiency and simplicity.

how to assign another variable to same literal

To assign another variable to the same string literal in Java, simply declare the new variable with the same string value. When using string literals, Java ensures that the new variable references the same object in the String Pool.

Example:
java
Copy code
String a = "java"; // Creates a literal in the String Pool
String b = "java"; // Points to the same literal in the String Pool

// Comparisons
System.out.println(a == b); // true (both reference the same object)
System.out.println(a.equals(b)); // true (contents are the same)
Explanation:
In the example above, both a and b reference the same object in the String Pool. Java checks if the literal "java" already exists in the pool, and if it does, it reuses that object instead of creating a new one.
Key Points:
String Pool Reusability: When you assign the same string literal to another variable, the new variable references the same object in the String Pool.
Memory Efficiency: This avoids creating duplicate objects for the same string, saving memory.
If you want the new variable to reference a different object (even if the content is the same), you would need to use the new keyword:

java
Copy code
String a = "java";
String b = new String("java");

// Comparisons
System.out.println(a == b); // false (different memory locations)
System.out.println(a.equals(b)); // true (contents are the same)
When to Assign the Same Literal
Using the same literal is most common in programs for simplicity and memory optimization.
